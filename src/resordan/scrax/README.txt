Scrax: Shape characterisation from radar cross-sections

The scrax library is a collection of software that characterises space debris objects in terms of their size and shape by means of statistics and machine learning tools. Characteristic dimensions of the objects are estimated from a sample of radar cross-sections, which are themselves predicted from signal-to-noise ratios measured by radar beam-park experiments.
